## Where can I get started?

First thing we need to do is install software called the Python interpreter. What is an interpreter?
- An interpreter is a program that understands the instructions you write ien Python.

Second, follow the steps listed below:

For Windows Users
1. Download the Windows x86-64 MSI installer from https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.2/python-3.10.2-amd64.exe and then double-click it. 
    - You may have to enter the administrator password for your computer. 
    - Follow the instructions the installer displays on the screen to install Python, as listed here:
        1. Select Install for All Users and then click Next.
        2. Install to the C:\Python34 folder by clicking Next.
        3. Click Next to skip the Customize Python section.
2. Start IDLE
    - What is an IDLE? 
      ## `I`nteractive `D`eve`L`opment `E`nvironment.
      - Similar to a word processor for writing Python programs. 
      - To get started: click the Start menu in the lower-left corner of the screen, type IDLE, and select IDLE (Python GUI).
      - Next a window will appear that is called the interactive shell. Within the interactive shell window is where you begin writing your python code.
      - You can enter Python instructions into the interactive shell at the >>> prompt and Python will perform them. After the computer performs the instructions, a new >>> prompt will wait for your next instruction.
