There's a bunch of programming languages to choose from. The one we're going to focus on this course is Python. 

In this section we will discuss programming and programming languages. Let's start with the
the `who`, `what`, `where` and `how` of `programming`.

## `What` is programming ?

 
`Programming` is the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine (like a computer).

We can think about programming like this....

Who remembers getting a lego set as a gift? I'm talking about the big ones, with tons of lego pieces and multiple pages of instructions on how to build it.

[<img src='./images/LegoImage.jpeg' width='300' height='200' />](/images/LegoImage.jpeg)

- If you’ve ever build a lego set using the build instructions, you can think of yourself as the computer and the manual are written by the author(or programmer). 
- The author's manual provides you with a set of instructions which you (as the computer) read, and then build based on those instructions.. 
- The more complex the instructions, the more complex the result!”

### Why should we learning programming?

- The reason why I enjoy programming because I like the idea of creating programs to control a computer and it helps support my family and provide my kids the opporutnties I never had.

- **Programming can be used to solved problems.** 
  - We can use programming to create applications to: 
    - Automate sending reminders when to take medication.
    - To create facial recongiztion software to find criminals going through public spaces.
    - Automate sending out report cards to parents directly, instead of waiting them their kids. 

- Programming develops creative thinking. (ref [Coding 101: Programming Language Building Blocks](https://hackernoon.com/coding-101-programming-language-building-blocks-1w513uwe)
- Programming Provides Life-Changing Experiences (ref [Coding 101: Programming Language Building Blocks](https://hackernoon.com/coding-101-programming-language-building-blocks-1w513uwe)
- Programmers solve a problem by breaking it down into workable pieces to understand it better. When you start learning to program, you develop the habit of working your way out in a very structured format. You analyze the problem and start thinking logically and this gives rise to more creative solutions you’ve ever given. (ref [Coding 101: Programming Language Building Blocks](https://hackernoon.com/coding-101-programming-language-building-blocks-1w513uwe))
- "Whether you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you just want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn." - Stephen Hawking
- "Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer… because it teaches you how to think." - Steve Jobs

## `Who` can do programming?
## Anyone......
Really anyone can learn how to program. As long as you're curious, have the ability to 'think out of the box' and can solve problems, then you have the tools to program. 

You probably are know some of the programming concepts because they were tought to you in your Math classes. 

## `Where` can you do programming?

Programming can be done on a computer, a tablet, or even your cell phones. Both the Apple and Google Play stores have apps you can install on your smart phone that will allow you to program on your phone.

For larger size applications or software, like games, websites, mobile apps, you'll need a computer with larger size resources, than you typically would have on your tablet and cell phone.
For example:

- SoloLearn (avaliable in both Apple and Google Play stores.) and Pythonista 3 (avaliable only in the Apple store) are apps where you can start learning to program through your phone.

## `How` do we get started with programming ?

 To get started programming you will need the following items:


 - A computer with a text editor application..
   - A text editor is an application where you can type text into and save your work onto your computer. An example of a text editor is Notepad. Notepad is a text editor application that is installed when you install Windows onto your machine. 

      [<img src='./images/notepad.jpeg' width='100' height='100' />](./images/notepad.jpeg)

      Notepad is not just the only text editor out there. There's other text editor applications that comes with more tools and features that makes programming much easier. These specific type of text editors are called IDE or Intergrated Development Environments. 
      
      We will talk more about IDE later on in this course, but just remember that you can use Notepad to start programming.
- Then the last thing you need to choose is a `programming language`. Programming languages are installed through an executable a which includes tools and other programs that will allow you to start programming and create your own programs. Next lets discuss what is a programming language.

### What is a programming language ?

- So we defined programming as the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine to execute.

- A 'programming language' (or coding) is the process of transforming those ideas into a written language that a computer can understand.

- Programming languages are written in English (or you can think of it as `human readable code`. I'll share later why this is important later).

- The actual instructions can be created using any document editor like notepad, Word, but when you save file, you must save using the proper file extension so you can execute your instructions. In software world, we call these instructions `source code`. We'll talk more about this later, just know the instructions that are written to a file is called source code. [Click here to read more about programming languages](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/programming-languages/)

- Not all programming languages are created the equal. 
- A programming language has its own set of rules on how to code in that specific language, but all langauges uses a common set of arithmetic operators, control structures and data structures that probably has used in your math classes, such functions, tables, matrixes, '+', '-', '/', '<=', '>=' and more......
- Most applications are built using one or more programming languages. Why?
- Each programming language were designed to solve a particular problem(s) and they can also be used togeather to create biggera and better applications. Most of the websites you use today uses a multituide of languages, some are listed in the image below. 

  [<img src='./images/ProgramLanguageUses.png' width='500' height='425' />](./images/notepad.jpeg)

Next let's discuss the building blocks of a programming language.

## The `building blocks` of a programming languages ? 

[Start From Here - read the articles below and include them into this section.]

https://betterprogramming.pub/building-blocks-programming-language-fundamentals-481ff296b477

What do you mean by building blocks? Let's think about the English language.
- The English language consists of nonus, verbs, adverbs, adjective, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions and interjuctions. These are called 'Parts of Speech'. We use these elements in order to write a complete and comprehensive sentences.
- Most programming languages has its own 'Parts of Speech' concept which we will call `building block elements`. 
- These `building block elements` is a blueprint to building sucessfull programming languages. In addition we will also talk about object oriented programming concepts because Python is an object oriented programming language. 
  - An object oriented programming is a programming model that organizes software design around data or objects rather than functions and logic. There's manu more programming models such as:
    - `Functional programming` - used alot in the data science field.
    - `Structured or module programming` - used for building web and mobile apps.
    - `Imperative programming` - focuses on function rather than models. Used in IOT (internet of things), robotic projects.
    - `Declarative programming` - involves statements on what the task or desired outcomes is. Used alot in automation and machine learning tasks.
    - `Logical programming` - used in artifical intelligence projects.
- Lets dive into the `building block elements`:
  - `Syntax`: 
    - This tells us the rules of how to write code in a specific language. 
    - Similar to writing sentences in the English, we must have the following: 
      - A sentence must begin with a captial letter and end with a punctuation mark.
      - A sentence must contain a subject, a predicate and complete thought.
    - The same is true for a programming language. The syntax for a programming language is part of the documentation that comes with any programming language. 
  - `Semantics`: 
    - Defines the effect\meaning the instructions have(logic). 
    - This defines the understanding of your source code.  
  - `Data Types`: 
    - Defines the classification of data we want to store in memory.
    - We can think of data types as a way to define a number or text in a programming language. 
      - For example: 
        - We can define `1` as an integer data type because it represents a number. 
        - We can define `3.4` as a decimal data type because it represents a number with a decimal.
        - We can define `test` as a string data type because it represents text.
        - There's more data types outside of intergers, decimal and strings, which we will learn later on.
        - Now there's one more data type we need to know  and its important to know...This special data type is called `object`. 
        - An `object` data type is a 'catch all' for all data types. All data types inherit from an object data type. Intergers, Decimal, String are the children of an `object` data type, they inherit all the *qualities* or characteristics of an object data type.
  - `Terms:`
    - These are commonly used buzzwords we use to describe a piece of code, such as Paramters, Keywords Variables, Expressions, Statements, Functions, Classes and many more. 
    - `Literals`:
      - Is a programming is a piece of text that represents a fixed value in source code. Examples of literals:
      ```python
      123    # an interger literal
      1.23   # a floating point literal
      'test' # a string literal 
      # a boolean literal - Boolean is a data type that defines two values: True or False
      x = True  
      a = { x: 1, y: 2} # an object literal.
      ```
    - `Operators`:
      - Its a symbol that tells the compiler (or interpreter) to perform a mathematical, logical, relational or other operation as defined in the language specification.
      - For example:
        - Common operators: 
          - arithmetic: +(plus), - (minus), *( multiply), / (divide)
          - assignment: = (equals)
          - logic: !(NOT), && (AND), || (OR)
          - equality testing: ==, !=
          - function call: ()
          - increment / decrement: ++, --
          - member selection: .
          - order relations: <(less than), <= (less than or equal), > (greater than), >= (greater than or equal)
        - An operator can also be a word. For example `sizeof` is an operator in the C language  which returns  the storage created for a given data type.
        - An operator that takes one argument is called *unary operator*. For example: 
        ```python
            a++ # unary operator
        ```
        - An operator that takes two arguments is called a *binary operator*. For example: 
        ```python
          a+b # a binary operator
        ```
    - `Statements`:
      - Is a unit of executable code that does not return a value. 
      - Statements may contain a mixture of variables, operators, literals and other keywords (keywords are words that serve one specific purpose and cannot be used in any other way defined by the programming language).
      - For example:
      ``` python
      # Simple statements
      a = 10 # variable a
      b = 9 # variable b
      a = b # We are assigning the value of variable b to the value of variable a. In case we are overridding the value. 
      # Return statement
      return a # returns the value of variable a.
      # if statements
      if(a < b) return c:
      # loop statements
      for a in numbers { 
        print(a) 
      }
      # switch statements
      fruit = 'Banana'
      if fruit == 'Mango': 
          print("letter is Mango") 
      elif fruit == "Grapes": 
          print("letter is Grapes") 
      elif fruit == "Banana": 
          print("fruit is Banana") 
      else: 
          print("fruit isn't Banana, Mango or Grapes") 
      ```
    - `Expressions`:
      - A unit of executable code that returns a value.
      - Examples are:
      ```python
        1 + 2 # uses the binary operator to return the value 3
        a * b # uses the '*' operator and returning a multiplied by b
        !a    # uses the unary operator and returns a boolean value (false)
        # Expressions and statements can be combined
        a = b + c # this statement says take the binary operator '+' and add the value of variable 'b' and 'c' and then assign the value to variable 'a' 
        # b + c is an expression
        # a = b + c is a statement.
      ```
    - `Operator Precedence and Associativity`:
      - Is the set of rules that determines in what order operators are applied within a complex expression.
      ``` python
      (2 -1 ? 0 : 1) == 0 # this expression and statement says:
      # 1. subtract '1' from 2'
      # 2. '?/ represents the if statement. If 2-1 is equal to '0' (defined by '== 0).
      # If 2-1 is equal to 0, then return '0' else return '1'
      ```
    - `Functions\Methods`:
      - Its a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
      - Example:
      ``` python
        # AddTwoNumbers is a block of code that will add two numbers and return it to its caller.
        # This is one of the ways how functions are defined in Python.
        def AddTwoNumbers(A, B): 
            return A+B
        print(AddTwoNumbers(1,2)) # print() is also a function that display data to a screen.
      ```
    - `Properties or Attributes`:
      - Represents the characteristics of an object. 
      - An object can be car, person, house, etc.....The properties (or attributes) represents the color of the house or the model of the car or age of a person. These are details that describes the details about the object. 
    - `Class`:
      - Is a blueprint for that defines the properties and functions common to all objects of a certain kind.
      - We can think a class like a Human
      ``` python
       class Human:
         # These are properties of a car object or the characteristics of a car. 
         name: str
         email: str
         address: str
         age: int
         def __init__(self, Name, Email, Address, Age): # this is called a constructor
             # A constructor is a special function that prepares the object to be used within your code. Its called when you're ready to create object in your code.
             self.name = Name
             self.email = Email
             self.address = Address
             self.wheelSize = WheelSize
             self.age = Age


         def VerifyIdentity(Name, Address, Age):
             # This function verifies the identity of the person.
             if(self.name == Name && self.address == Address && self.age == Age):
                return True
             else:
                return False
         
         def SendEmail(Email):
             # This function sends an email based on the email value provided.
             SendEmailFromGoogle(Email)
             return True

        # Here is how to create a Human object in memory.
        # When the Human object is created, the __init__() method is called to prepare the object to be used.
        newHuman = Human('Brandon Hunter','bhunter@gmail.com', '5555 Apple Drive, Oil City, MA 29123', 40 ) 
        IsSamePerson = newHuman.VerifyIdentity('Brandon Black','',34)
        if(IsSamePerson == True):
           print("Hi Brandon")
        else:
           print("You're not Brandon")
             
      ```

  - `Data Structures:` 
    - Data structures are objects where we can store, organize and retrieve data. Examples are lists, arrays, matries, tables,etc....
    ``` python
    # this is an example of a list in Python
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    print(fruits[0]) # prints 'apple'

    # this is an example of a dictionary. It stores data in a key:value paris.
    car = { "brand": "Ford", "model": "Mustang", "year": 1964 }
    print(car["brand"]) # prints 'Ford'
    ```
   
  - `Algorithms:` 
    - An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve any computational problem. For example Fibonacci Sequence is a sequence of numbers and the next number is found by adding the two numbers before it. 
    ``` python
    # Program to display the Fibonacci sequence up to n-th term
    nterms = int(input("How many terms? "))

    # first two terms
    n1, n2 = 0, 1
    count = 0

    # check if the number of terms is valid
    if nterms <= 0:
       print("Please enter a positive integer")
    # if there is only one term, return n1
    elif nterms == 1:
         print("Fibonacci sequence upto",nterms,":")
         print(n1)
    # generate fibonacci sequence
    else:
        print("Fibonacci sequence:")
        while count < nterms:
              print(n1)
              nth = n1 + n2
              # update values
              n1 = n2
              n2 = nth
              count += 1
    ```
  - `Compilers`:
     - A compiler is a computer program that translate your source code into a machine-readable language for the computer to execute.
     - Basically its a translator.
     - Remember in the previous section computers speak in 1's and 0's or binrary. In order for you to run your code on your computer, we need a translator to translate your instructions (or source code) into a language that a computer understands in order for the computer to execute your instructions (or source code). After our break we will look into how programs are created and how can they run on computers.
## Lets take a 10 minute break

## How are programs created

### `What are Compilers (or Interpers)?`
Compiler is a program that translate `human readable code` into a `machine readable code` for the computer to execute.

`machine readable code` is binary code. Lets look at an example of how text and numbers are translated in to binary code.
- [DEMO: Convert To Binary Code (Python)](demos/convert_to_binary.py)

Each programming language has its compiler that is designed to read its own source code and translate the source code into machine code. 

Some programming languages has more than one compiler.

Most compilers are designed on different operating systems and different processor models such as Windows, Mac OS or Linux.

There are some compilers that only work on specifically one or two operating systems such as XCode. **_XCode is a programming language used to create apps for Apple products._**

Let's use the visualization below to walk through high level overview of how the compiler works:

[<img src='images/CompilerWorkflow.png' width='600' height='400' />](/images/CompilerWorkflow.png)

Lets say you're writing a python script to turn on the lights in your house.

You write your code in your IDE (Intergrated Development Environment) or an editor, and then you save youyr changes using the apporiate file extension, in this case its `py`. 

`Why would you have to save the file with the .py file extension?` Since we're writing a script using Python, the Python's compiler looks for files with that file extension. Once the compiler finds that file, then compiler begins compling process. Every programming languages has a similar process.

Afte saving your changes, then you click the a run or `play` button within your IDE to start the compiler. 

During this time the compiler is doing the following:
    
- Reads your code and tries to figure out the words within your source code.` 

- Next, the compiler verifies the grammar (or syntax) in your source code by organizing your source code into `parse tree`.

- Next, the compiler records all the variables, functions and classes (and other related items) that the computer needs to keep track in your program.

- Then finally the compiler `traverses` the tree and figures identifies which machine code that would effectly do the same thing as your source code. This is the part where it translate your code into machine code. 
    
  - *Note - there's a little more that goes on before the source code is compiled into machine code.*

- If the compiler reports no errors with your code, then the compiler completes the process by creating an executalbe program that you can run on your computer.

- If errors are found, by the compiler, within your source code, meaning mispelling of words or the incorrect use of a keyword or other errors, then the compiler will stop and return the errors back to your IDE. 
   

 
Computers don't understand how to read `human readable code`. A computer understands 1's and 0's or binary code. Let's take a look at what binary looks like : 
  

## Lets Recap
- We discuss what is programming. `Programming is ?` It's the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine (like a computer).
- We discussed who can program...Anyone all you need is a computer with an editor (IDE) and install the necessary software to code and compile in the programming language you select.
- We discussed some concepts of programming such syntax, semantics, terms such as literals, expressions, variables, data types functions and classes, and then data structures, alogrithims and then compilers.
- We discussed compilers, what they are and how they work from high level point of view.

# TODO
- Talk about how to execute your program on a computer.
- Explain how source code is translated into binary
- Talk about compilers at a high level.
- Explain that they're different ways programs are created based on the programming language.
- Create a program that will write a person's name is binary
- Last statement should lead into the next section which is Python and then link to the Python discussion.
###Ok, so how does a computer know how to run my program?

[![Watch the video](https://i.imgur.com/vKb2F1B.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXjU9qTsYCc)


Programming languages comes with its own built 'translator' to translate the source code into binary code.

For example: 

C#, its a compiled programming language, where a machine (computer) has the tools to translate your source code into binary code (machine code) in order to run your program.

Python, is a interpreted language, where it uses a program called an interpreter (think of it as a sandbox), that will read and execute your source code. The interpreter comes with Python installed package.


Now, not all programming lanagues are made equal. Some langauges can be used to create various applications, while others are designed to one or two things specifically.
![ProgrammingLanagueUses](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/eb/17/3e/eb173e345290c58823232e966d185a3e.jpg)

In this course we will focus on the Python programming language.

## Lets take a 10 minute break
- Get up from your chairs, move around, get a drink and stretch.

## What is Python and how can it be use
- Its program language that can be used to do 'stuff' on computers.
- Its a interpreted language....What does that mean???
  - Most programming language is written using the English language. For example: In python the 
  -  Computers has their own language, which is called binary.
  - The source code Every program\or software is a set of instructions, whether its to add two numbers or send an email over the internet.
  - Compilers and interpreters
- First developed in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum.
- Its used for creating websites, creating software, creating games, used in mathematics and more.
