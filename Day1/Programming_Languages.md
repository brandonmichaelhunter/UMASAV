As you can see in the picture above, there's a bunch of lanauges out there.

## Let's break down what is programming and what is a program language and why we should learn programming

### What is programming ?

`Programming` is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute. 

We can think about programming as this....

Who remembers getting a lego set as a gift? I'm talking about the big ones, with tons of lego pieces and multiple pages of instructions on how to build it.

[<img src='./LegoImage.jpeg' width='300' height='200' />](./LegoImage.jpeg)

- If you‚Äôve ever build a lego set using the build instructions, you can think of yourself as the computer and the instructions author as a programmer. 
- The instructions author provides you with a set of instructions which you read and then follow. 
- The more complex the instructions, the more complex the result!‚Äù

### What is a programming language ?
`Programming languages` are the tools we use to write instructions for computers to follow. 

- Computers ‚Äúthink‚Äù in binary ‚Äî strings of 1s and 0s. 
[<img src='./binarycode.jpeg' width='200' height='200' />](./binarycode.jpeg)
- Programming languages allow us to translate the 1s and 0s into something that humans can understand and write. 

-A programming language is made up of a series of symbols that serves as a bridge that allow humans to translate our thoughts into instructions computers can understand.

Let's see what we can do with programming languages:
- You can create online, mobile and desktop games.
- You can create a website for posting information online like a blog or a fourmn
- You can create an applications for your business to help track sales, inventory and process online orders.
- You can also create online tools for education, like Google Classroom. Google Classroom virtualize the learning experience by offering teachers and students a space create, complete and collobrate on class assignments.

### Why should we learning programming?

The reason why I enjoy programming because it motivates me to learn and I like the idea of creating programs to control a computer.

#### Let's look at othe reasons why we should learn programming...
- Programming develops creative thinking. (ref [Coding 101: Programming Language Building Blocks](https://hackernoon.com/coding-101-programming-language-building-blocks-1w513uwe)
- Programming Provides Life-Changing Experiences (ref [Coding 101: Programming Language Building Blocks](https://hackernoon.com/coding-101-programming-language-building-blocks-1w513uwe)
- Programmers solve a problem by breaking it down into workable pieces to understand it better. When you start learning to program, you develop the habit of working your way out in a very structured format. You analyze the problem and start thinking logically and this gives rise to more creative solutions you‚Äôve ever given. (ref [Coding 101: Programming Language Building Blocks](https://hackernoon.com/coding-101-programming-language-building-blocks-1w513uwe))
- "Whether you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you just want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn." - Stephen Hawking
- "Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer‚Ä¶ because it teaches you how to think." - Steve Jobs

Next let's discuss the building blocks of a programming language?
## What does a program language look like? 

- Programming languges differ based on their purpose, some have the ability to create programs on your machine while others are used to retrieve data, but all programming languages are made up of the same components:
  - `Syntax`: are the rules for how a sentence is constructed. In programming is the rules for how each instructions is written
  - `Semantics`: Semantics is the actual meaning of statements.
In a programming language, Semantics is the effect the instructions have(logic).
  - `Data Types`: A Data Type is a classification of data we want to store in memory. Data Types can vary from one language to another. But the type of data we would like to store is common across all languages.
  - `Terms`: When it comes to a programming language there are these terms(buzzwords) you may come across in your learning journey. Some commonly used terms are Variables, Expressions, Statements, Functions, Classes and many more. You don‚Äôt need to worry if you feel any difficulties, use this Dictionaryüëá as a resource.
  - `Data Structures`: A data structure is how we can store, access, organize and manage the data we have created in a computer.
  - `Algorithms`: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve any computational problem. And when it comes to Computer Science, there are a bunch of algorithms which are must to know ones.

Let's break down each component in the code examples below:

For example:

```python
def AddTwoNumbers(A, B):
    return A+B
```
[PICK UP FRIOM HERE]
In this example we are using the programming language **Python**, written as code, to create a function (or a section of a code that performs a specific task.) that will add two numbers. 

So let's break down the syntax.....

The Python's syntax for creating a function is: type + name + parameter(s) + instructions
- What is type? **def**
- What is name? **AddTwoNumbers**
- What is parameter(s)? **A** and **B**
- What is instructions? **return A+B*

###Ok, so how does a computer know how to run my program?

[![Watch the video](https://i.imgur.com/vKb2F1B.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXjU9qTsYCc)

So you have programming languages which you can use to create a program. Once you're program is created, then you can run your program on a computer.

Computers only know one language and that is binary code (or machine code). We'll talk about binary later, but for now just know computers only understands binary code.

So we have a program, written in specific programming language.

And we have a computer that only understands binrary code.
[NEED AN IMAGE FOR BINARY CODE]

How do we get the computer to understand my program?????

We use a program that can translate my source code (program language) into binary code. How do we do that?

We don't....That is handled by the programming language you choose. 

Programming languages comes with its own built 'translator' to translate the source code into binary code.

For example: 

C#, its a compiled programming language, where a machine (computer) has the tools to translate your source code into binary code (machine code) in order to run your program.

Python, is a interpreted language, where it uses a program called an interpreter (think of it as a sandbox), that will read and execute your source code. The interpreter comes with Python installed package.

### What can you do with programming langauges?
You can use programming langauges to do:
- Create websites, and create desktop and mobile applications.
- Create desktop and online games for systems such as XBox, PlayStation and more...
- Creating and\or deleting files and folders.
- Install or Unistall Software.
- Send emails or send texts and more....

Now, not all programming lanagues are made equal. Some langauges can be used to create various applications, while others are designed to one or two things specifically.

In this course we will focus on the Python programming language. 

How is a python a programming language?

It's not!!! I'm not talking about the snake called Python, I'm talking about about a programming language named Python.

So.....What is Python?

## Lets take a 10 minute break
- Get up from your chairs, move around, get a drink and stretch.

## What is Python and how can it be use
- Its program language that can be used to do 'stuff' on computers.
- Its a interpreted language....What does that mean???
  - Most programming language is written using the English language. For example: In python the 
  -  Computers has their own language, which is called binary.
  - The source code Every program\or software is a set of instructions, whether its to add two numbers or send an email over the internet.
  - Compilers and interpreters
- First developed in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum.
- Its used for creating websites, creating software, creating games, used in mathematics and more.
