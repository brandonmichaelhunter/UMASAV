# What are programming lanagues?

As you can see in the picture above, there's a bunch of lanauges out there.

## Let's break down what is programming and what is a program language

`Programming` is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute. 

We can think about programming as this....

Who remembers getting a lego set as a gift? I'm talking about the big ones, with tons of lego pieces and multiple pages of instructions on how to build it.

- If you’ve ever build a lego set using the build instructions, you can think of yourself as the computer and the instructions author as a programmer. 
- The instructions author provides you with a set of instructions which you read and then follow. 
- The more complex the instructions, the more complex the result!”

`Programming languages` are the tools we use to write instructions for computers to follow. 

- Computers “think” in binary — strings of 1s and 0s. 
[<img src='./binarycode.jpeg' width='200' height='200' />](./binarycode.jpeg)
- Programming languages allow us to translate the 1s and 0s into something that humans can understand and write. 

-A programming language is made up of a series of symbols that serves as a bridge that allow humans to translate our thoughts into instructions computers can understand.

Let's see what we can do with programming languages:
- You can create online, mobile and desktop games.
- You can create a website for posting information online like a blog or a fourmn
- You can create an applications for your business to help track sales, inventory and process online orders.
- You can also create online tools for education, like Google Classroom. Google Classroom virtualize the learning experience for teachers and students to manage and work on assignments online.

So these are just a couple of things you can create using programming languages.
## What does a program language look like? [Next]

Programming languges differ based on their syntax and how it create excutable programs.

Let's start with syntax..

Syntax is an arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language. 

For example: 

For the english language the most basic syntax follows a subject + verb + direct object. 

- **'Jillian hit the ball.'**
- What is the subject ? The person or thing being discussed, which is **Jillian**
- What is the verb ? The action-giver, which is **hit**
- What id direct object? The receiving the action of the verb, which is **ball**

The same goes for programming languages, we need to understand the programming language's syntax in order to talk to computers.

For example:

```python
def AddTwoNumbers(A, B):
    return A+B
```

In this example we are using the programming language **Python**, written as code, to create a function (or a section of a code that performs a specific task.) that will add two numbers. 

So let's break down the syntax.....

The Python's syntax for creating a function is: type + name + parameter(s) + instructions
- What is type? **def**
- What is name? **AddTwoNumbers**
- What is parameter(s)? **A** and **B**
- What is instructions? **return A+B*

###Ok, so how does a computer know how to run my program?

[![Watch the video](https://i.imgur.com/vKb2F1B.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXjU9qTsYCc)

So you have programming languages which you can use to create a program. Once you're program is created, then you can run your program on a computer.

Computers only know one language and that is binary code (or machine code). We'll talk about binary later, but for now just know computers only understands binary code.

So we have a program, written in specific programming language.

And we have a computer that only understands binrary code.
[NEED AN IMAGE FOR BINARY CODE]

How do we get the computer to understand my program?????

We use a program that can translate my source code (program language) into binary code. How do we do that?

We don't....That is handled by the programming language you choose. 

Programming languages comes with its own built 'translator' to translate the source code into binary code.

For example: 

C#, its a compiled programming language, where a machine (computer) has the tools to translate your source code into binary code (machine code) in order to run your program.

Python, is a interpreted language, where it uses a program called an interpreter (think of it as a sandbox), that will read and execute your source code. The interpreter comes with Python installed package.

### What can you do with programming langauges?
You can use programming langauges to do:
- Create websites, and create desktop and mobile applications.
- Create desktop and online games for systems such as XBox, PlayStation and more...
- Creating and\or deleting files and folders.
- Install or Unistall Software.
- Send emails or send texts and more....

Now, not all programming lanagues are made equal. Some langauges can be used to create various applications, while others are designed to one or two things specifically.

In this course we will focus on the Python programming language. 

How is a python a programming language?

It's not!!! I'm not talking about the snake called Python, I'm talking about about a programming language named Python.

So.....What is Python?

## Lets take a 10 minute break
- Get up from your chairs, move around, get a drink and stretch.

## What is Python and how can it be use
- Its program language that can be used to do 'stuff' on computers.
- Its a interpreted language....What does that mean???
  - Most programming language is written using the English language. For example: In python the 
  -  Computers has their own language, which is called binary.
  - The source code Every program\or software is a set of instructions, whether its to add two numbers or send an email over the internet.
  - Compilers and interpreters
- First developed in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum.
- Its used for creating websites, creating software, creating games, used in mathematics and more.

Python allows you to create desktop, web and mobile applications. Python can be used to create games, send emails, create websites and more.....
