# What is Computer Science
"Computer Science is the study of computers and computational systems. Unlike electrical and computer engineers, computer scientists deal mostly with software and software systems; this includes their theory, design, development, and application.

Principal areas of study within Computer Science include artificial intelligence, computer systems and networks, security, database systems, human computer interaction, vision and graphics, numerical analysis, **programming languages**, **software engineering**, bioinformatics and theory of computing.

Although knowing how to program is essential to the study of computer science, it is only one element of the field. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms to solve programs and study the performance of computer hardware and software. 

The problems that computer scientists encounter range from the abstract-- determining what problems can be solved with computers and the complexity of the algorithms that solve them – to the tangible – designing applications that perform well on handheld devices, that are easy to use, and that uphold security measures." (Dept of Computer Science at University of Marlyand) 

In this course we will not cover every aspect of Computer Science, but we will focus on a little bit on computers,then programming languages and then discuss some software engineering topics. 

## What are computers?
Its machine which are made up of hardware and software components.

A computer can be a desktop computer, your laptops, a tablet, and your cell phone.

You can use computers to visit websites, send email, perform calculations, read documents, play games and more....

### Let's talk about the computer's hardware and software components

Hardware represents the physical components that are needed to run a computer.

Here are some common hardware components and their purpose inside of a computer:
- Memory: short term storage. Temporary stores data used by programs\software.
- CPU (Central Processing Unit): processes commands given by end users and\or software.
- Motherboard: Runs the machine
- Video Card: Provides the graphics for a computer
- NIC (Network Interface Card): Provides internet for a computer
- Hard Drives (HHD or SSD): Stores files, programs for long term storage.

Software represents a program(s) running on a computer. 

Software is made up of source code (or **commands**\instructions), written using a **programming language**, and compiled into a program for end users to consume.

Here are some examples of common programs (or software) that you will find on a computer:
- Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint: used to created documents
- Email Client: used to send emails
- Computer games: used to play games on a computer :)
- Command consoles: used to execute **commands** on a computer.

## What are commands? 
Merriam-Webster defines command as 
- to give (someone) an order: to tell (someone) to do something in a forceful and often offical way or 
- to have authority and control over (a group of people, such as soliders) or
- **to give orders**

Some examples of commands are:
- Clean your room.
- Take the trash out.
- Complete your assignments before tomorrow.

Theses are examples command, where one person **gives orders** for another person to follow or **execute**.

What is execute?
- To do or perform (an action or movement that requires skill)

For example:

Who knows what is an IPhone?
The IPhone is a smartphone made by Apple that combines a **computer**, IPod(transition into ITunes), digital camera and cellular phone into one device with a touchshreen interface.

IPhones are equiped with software that end users can use to **execute** specific **commands** on their phone, like make a phone call, send emails or ask Siri questions.....

### What is Siri?
Apple IPhones has built-in voice-controlled personal assistant called Siri. You can ask her questions, tell her to show you something or issue her **commands** for her to **execute** on your behalf, hands-free.

Let's demostrate Siri: 

Ask Siri who won the world series this year? Share with the class.

**How does Siri know who won the world series?**

Siri is trained to learn about you through the data on your phone and its trained to stay updated with the information on the web. 

Siri has the **required skills** to **execute** almost any **commands** you ask.

*Computers, Execute, Commands....Whats the point?*
You, humands can command a computer to do what you want it to do. We can uses different programs, like Siri, to **execute commands** that we need completed.

You provide the instructions to the computer and the computer will **execute** your **command**.

Next, [let's discuss how we can communicate our instructions\commands for a computer to execute](https://github.com/brandonmichaelhunter/UMASAV/blob/beetle/Day1/Communicate_With_Computers.md)
