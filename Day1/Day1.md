# Day 1 - Introduction to Python

Welcome students. This page is designed as a resource for you to use when working on your assignments and labs.

## What are commands? 
Merriam-Webster defines command as 
- to give (someone) an order: to tell (someone) to do something in a forceful and often offical way or 
- to have authority and control over (a group of people, such as soliders) or
- **to give orders**

Some examples of commands are:
- Clean your room.
- Take the trash out.
- Complete your assignments before tomorrow.

Theses are examples command, where one person **gives orders** for another person to follow or **execute**.

What is execute?
- To do or perform (an action or movement that requires skill)

For example:

Who knows what is an IPhone?
The IPhone is a smartphone made by Apple that combines a **computer**, IPod(transition into ITunes), digital camera and cellular phone into one device with a touchshreen interface.

IPhones are equiped with software that end users can use to **execute** specific **commands** on their phone, like make a phone call, send emails or ask Siri questions.....

### What is Siri?
Apple IPhones has built-in voice-controlled personal assistant called Siri. You can ask her questions, tell her to show you something or issue her **commands** for her to **execute** on your behalf, hands-free.

Let's demostrate Siri: 

Ask Siri who won the world series this year? Share with the class.

**How does Siri know who won the world series?**

Siri is trained to learn about you through the data on your phone and its trained to stay updated with the information on the web. 

Siri has the **required skills** to **execute** almost any **commands** you ask.

*Computers, Execute, Commands....Whats the point?*
You, humands can command a computer to do what you want it to do. We can uses different programs, like Siri, to **execute commands** that we need completed.

You provide the instructions to the computer and the computer will **execute** your **command**.

Next, let's discuss how we can communicate our instructions\commands for a computer to execute.

## How do we communicate with computers

1. Using a command console
2. Using a programming languages
3. Using thrid party software

Let's start with command consoles

### Command Consoles

A command console is an application on you computer where you can issue complete tasks.

A command console can be used to communciate with a computer.

You can use command consoles to perform the following commands:
- Creating or deleteing a folder and\or files.
- Executing software
- Communicate with other computers

This is what a command console looks like on a PC.

### What are some common commands that we can execute using a command console?

Next, lets discuss **programming languages**

What are programming lanagues?
![Programming Languages](https://gowithcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/top-programming-languages.jpg)

As you can see in the picture above, there's a bunch of lanauges out there.

You can think of programming lanagues as a way for us to talk to computers. Similar to how we use English to talk to each other, programming lanagues can be used in teh same way.

Programming languages can be used give instructions\commands for the computer to execute. 

For example, you can use programming langauges to do:
- Create websites, and create desktop and mobile applications.
- Create desktop and online games for systems such as XBox, PlayStation and more...
- Creating and\or deleting files and folders.
- Install or Unistall Software.
- Send emails or send texts and more....

Now, not all programming lanagues are made equal. Some langauges can be used to create various apllications, while other programming lanagues are designed to one or two things specifically.

In this course we will focus on the Python programming language. 

How is a python a programming language?

It's not!!! I'm not talking about the snake called Python, I'm talking about about a programming language named Python.

## What is Python and how can it be use

Python allows you to create desktop, web and mobile applications. Python can be used to create games, send emails, create websites and more.....
### Download and Install Python
