# Day 1 - Introduction to Python

Welcome students. This page is designed as a resource for you to use when working on your assignments and labs.

## What are commands? 
Merriam-Webster defines command as 
- to give (someone) an order: to tell (someone) to do something in a forceful and often offical way or 
- to have authority and control over (a group of people, such as soliders) or
- **to give orders**

Some examples of commands are:
- Clean your room.
- Take the trash out.
- Complete your assignments before tomorrow.

Theses are examples command, where one person **gives orders** for another person to follow or **execute**.

What is execute?
- To do or perform (an action or movement that requires skill)

For example:

Who knows what is an IPhone?
The IPhone is a smartphone made by Apple that combines a **computer**, IPod(transition into ITunes), digital camera and cellular phone into one device with a touchshreen interface.

IPhones are equiped with software that end users can use to **execute** specific **commands** on their phone, like make a phone call, send emails or ask Siri questions.....

### What is Siri?
Apple IPhones has built-in voice-controlled personal assistant called Siri. You can ask her questions, tell her to show you something or issue her **commands** for her to **execute** on your behalf, hands-free.

Let's demostrate Siri: 

Ask Siri who won the world series this year? Share with the class.

**How does Siri know who won the world series?**

Siri is trained to learn about you through the data on your phone and its trained to stay updated with the information on the web. 

Siri has the **required skills** to **execute** almost any **commands** you ask.

*Computers, Execute, Commands....Whats the point?*
You, humands can command a computer to do what you want it to do. We can uses different programs, like Siri, to **execute commands** that we need completed.

You provide the instructions to the computer and the computer will **execute** your **command**.

Next, let's discuss how we can communicate our instructions\commands for a computer to execute.

## How do we communicate with computers

There's a couple of ways we can communicate with computers:
- Using a command console
  - A command console is an application on a computer where you can issue such commands as:
    - Creating or deleteing a folder and\or files.
    - Executing software
    - Communicate with other computers
- Using programming languages
  - There are various program languagesthat can be used to create web, mobile and desktop applications that will help you communicate with your computer to execute commands such as. 
    - Python is a program language. You can create a desktop application using Python that will help you send emails from your computer.
    - Java is another program language. You can create a mobile application that allow you to take pictures
