# How do we communicate with computers

1. Using a Command console (or Windows Command console)
2. Using a programming languages
3. Using thrid party software

Let's start with command consoles

### Windows Command Consoles

A command console is an application that is installed on your computer which you can use to execute commands that you give to it.

A command console can be used to communciate with a computer.

If a user wants to execute a command, the user will type in the command into the console screen and then hit the 'Enter' key. Once the 'Enter' key is clicked, then the command is sent to the computer and the computer will execute your command.

You can use command consoles to perform the following commands:
- Creating or deleteing a folder and\or files.
- Executing software
- Communicate with other computers

This is what a command console looks like on a PC.

| **cls** | This command wipes the command screen clean | cls |
| **Systeminfo** | This command give you a detailed configuration overview for your computer. | systeminfo |

Let's review.....
- A command console is an application that is installed on your computer which you can execute commands that you give to it.
- When you type in commands into the command console and hit the enter key, you are communicating with the computer by giving the computer a task\command to complete.
- Some of the commands that you can execute are: systeminfo, tasklist, title, and color.

We learned that the command console is an application. How are applications created? They're created using programming languages.
