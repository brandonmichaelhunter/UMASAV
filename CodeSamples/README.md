# Python
What is Python? Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aims to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

- Flexible programming language
- Designed to be human readable
- Great starter language, and has a wonderful community.
- Helps teaches you good development practices.

# Lesson Plan Plan
- Using print statement
    - print("Hello") - displays to a screen.
        - Use single quote or double quote, but be consistent.
        - If you're content needs to include a single quote like It's cold today, then you wrap this content within double quotes. For example print("It's code today")
    - input()
    - Insert blank lines
        - print()
        - print('Test \nadds a blank line)
    - Debugging with print - see which lines are failing and which lines are not failing
- Install Python
  - Create a folder on your C drive
  - Open VSCode
    - Create New File
    - type in code
    - Save file as .py
- Comments
    - '#' allows you add comments to your code.
    - Content behind the '#' will not run.
    - '#' is use to explain to your source code to other developers.
    - Also it remindes you what you were trying to write.
- String Concepts
    - Variables - acts as placeholders for you code.
        - Do not have to declare the variable
    - string literal
    - single quotes or double quotes, but be consistent.
    - Combine strings with '+' plus operator    
    - upper(), lower(), capitalize(), count(a)
    - Format strings
      - .format() or {<string>}
      - ouput = 'Hello, ' + first_name + ' ' + last_name
      - output = 'Hello {} {}'.format(first_name, last_name) or
      - output - 'Hello {0} {1}'.format(first_name, last_name) or
      - output = f'Hello, {first_name} {last_name}' # only avaliable in python 3
