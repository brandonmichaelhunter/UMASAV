# How do we communicate with computers
There's a couple of ways we can communicate with computers:
- Using a keyboard
- Voice commands
- Game Controllers
- Live Streams
- Touch pad
- Drones
- Sensors like motion detections    

We can call keyboards, voice commands, game controllers, live streams and sensors, `INPUTS`.

Each of these `INPUTS` produces a `command` for a machine (computer, tablet, game console, smart phone or smar watch) to `execute`. 

So this `command` is genreated by the input into a language or code called `Binary`. Binary code can be represented by any two symbols such as 1s and 0s. You can think of binary is a collection of off and on switches. For example:

This is `Brandon` spelled out in binary code

`01100010011100100110000101101110011001000110111101101110`  



Binary code or binary language or machine language or machine code, is basically code\language that machines understands. We'll talk more about binary later in the next section, but the point that I want you get here is that Inputs products commands in the form of `binary` code.  

Using the diagram below let's take a look at how `commands` from an input are communicated or processed to a machine for execution.

- **Input**:  Converts physical input to binary information (or binary code).
- **Memory**: Stores information
- **CPU**: Center Processing Unit calculates information.
- **Ouput**: Converts information to physical output.

## Example - What happens when I press keys on a keyboard
- Let's say I'd pressed key letter B on a keyboard. 
- Next the keyboard converts the letter B into a number or scan code (each key has one).
- Then from the input, the number is sent as binary, ones and zeros (101100111110), into a computer.
- Then the CPU calculcates how to display the 'B' pixel by pixel. 
- The CPU requests step by step instructions from memory on how draw the letter B.
- CPU execute these instructions and stores the results into memory.
- Finally the pixel information is sent in binary to the screen.
- The screen is output device, like a monitor. The monitor converts the binary data into the tiny lights and colors that you see on a screen. This is also true for Facetime, playing video games or sending texts.

There's one thing thats missing from this picture that works with a machine to gather data from inputs and helps processes data. That one thing is....**Programs**


## Programs
A program (or software program) is commonly defined as a set of instructions, or a set of modules or procedures, that allow for a certain type of computer operation. The term is also often used interchangeably with terms like “software application” and “software product.”

In the diagram above, its assume you know that the Operating System assists in processing input and producing output.

What's an operating system? 
- Its software, its a program thats installed on a computer and its job is to manage your computer and all the software that runs on the computer. 
- An opearting system uses other software to protect the computer from malware and virous.
- An operating system also monitors programs to make sure they don't consume to much of your primary resources like memory, cpu and\or hard drive spaces.
- Windows 10, MacOS, IOS are operating systems.

Operating systems is example of one program, but they're many more like:
1. A command console
2. Microsoft Paint
3. Solitaire
4. Many more..... 

Let's take a look at `command consoles` which is a program that is used by system adminstrators to help troubleshoot issues with computer like networking\internet issues.
### Command Consoles [PICK UP FROM HERE]

A command console is pre-installed application that can be run on your computer to execute commands.

A command consoles are used perform specific tasks based on the command you provid.

What are command consoles used for?

Command consoles are used for:
- Creating or changing files or folders.
- Gathering information about your computer such as OS info, gathering network information such as IP address or find out which Wifi your connected.
- Identify what connections are currently running on your machine.
- Running other programs
- Applying software updates.

Command console process data just any other program or actvity such pressing a keyboard:
- The command console takes input from a user.
- The data from the input is stored in memory and then processed by CPU
- Once cpu process is complete, the data is sent to the output for xthe end user to see the results.

This is a picture of a command window.

Here's how you can execute a command using the command console:
- Click on the console screen.
- Type in your command
- Hit the enter key
- Oberserved the results.
### Provided below are some comman commands that can execute using the command console.

| Commands | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **cls** | This command wipes the command screen clean | cls |
| **Systeminfo** | This command give you a detailed configuration overview for your computer. | systeminfo |
| **tasklist** | This command provdes a current list of all tasks running on your PC. | tasklist |
| **title** | This command chnage the title of the command prompt window. | title New Title
| **color** | This command changes the background color of the command prompt window. | color 1 9 |

**Note:**

Here are color codes that you can use with the **color** command
| Background Color Code | Foreground (text) Color Code| Example |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|---------|
| 0 (Black) | 8 (Gray) | color 0 8 |
| 1 (Blue) | 9 (Light Blue) | color 1 9 |
| 2 (Green) | A (Light Green)| color 2 A |
| 3 (Aqua) | B (Light Aqua)| color 3 B |
| 4 (Red) | C (Light Red)| color 4 C |
| 5 (Purple) | D (Light Purple)| color 5 D |
| 6 (Yellow) | E (Light Yellow)| color 6 E |
| 7 (White) | F (Bright White)| color 7 F |

## Lets Recap
- A computer processes information using 4 components togeather to produce an output. The components are Input, Memory, CPU and Output.
    - Inputs converts physical input to binary information. An example of an input are keybaords, cameras, drones or even a touch pad on a laptop.
    - Memory: Stores information
    - CPU: Center Processing Unit calculates information.
    - Ouput: Converts information to physical output.
- A program (or software program) is defined as a `set of instructions, or a set of modules or procedures, that allow for a certain type of computer operation`.
    - An example of program is a Command console.
    - A Command consoles is a pre-installed application that you can use to execute tasks on a computers.
        -  Common commands that you can perform using a command console are:  
            - Manage files and folders
            - Run other programs
            - Gather information about your computer. 


Next we're going to look at programming languages. Programming languages are used to build programs, create mobile apps and websites. A programming language are the `set of instructions or modules or procedures that allow for a certain type of computer operation`.
