## Its about solving problems using COMPUTERS!!!

`"Computer science develops studentsâ€™ computational and critical thinking skills and shows them how to create, not simply use,new technologies. This fundamental knowledge is needed to prepare students for the 21st century, regardless of their ultimate field of study or occupation. `

`Computer science education encompasses 'the study of computers and algorithmic processes, including their principles, their hardware and software designs, their applications, and their impact on society.`

A few of the topics and activities that might be included in a computer science course include:
- Algorithmic problem-solving
- Computing and data analysis (managing, processing, visualizing and interpreting data)
- Human-computer interaction
- Modeling and simulating real-world problems
- Creating and manipulating graphics
- Programming (including game design)
- Security (including cryptography)
- Web design (illustrating principles of programming, human-computer interaction and abstraction)
- Robotics (designing and programming)
- Ethical and social issues in computing"

# Computers - What are computers and how do they work

## What is a computer?
- A programmable device for processing, storing, and displaying information or 
- An electronic device that manipulates information (or data) using a combination of hardware and software
## What are some examples are a computer?
- We know of desktop and laptop computers, but what about....
  - Cell Phones
  - Tablets 
  - Drones
  - Smart Devices (Washers, Dryers, Refrigerators, Watches, Theromstats, Cars)
  - Game Consoles (XBox, PlayStation)
## What can you do with computers? 
- Work with documents, presentations, spreadsheets and save them to a computer.
- Send emails
- Play computer games and more....
In this section we'll disucss what are computers, how do they work and what are the parts that make up a computer.

The first step before start learning how to program, is learning how computers work.

*"A computer is a machine or device that performs processes, calculations and operations based on instructions provided by a software or hardware program. It has the ability to accept data (input), process it, and then produce outputs.*

*Computers can also store data for later uses in appropriate storage devices, and retrieve whenever it is necessary.*

*Modern computers are electronic devices used for a variety of purposes ranging from browsing the web, writing documents, editing videos, creating applications, playing video games, etc.*

*They are designed to execute applications and provide a variety of solutions by combining integrated hardware and software components.*

*The earliest digital electronic device that could be defined as the first modern computer is the Colossus. Built in 1943-44, the Colossus was devised to crack the Lorenz SZ 40/42, a German encryption machine used to support military communications during World War II.*

*The device used 2,400 vacuum tubes to perform multiple boolean logical operations to decode encrypted data.*"

## Let's recap!!
- Computer Science is about solving problems. 
- Computer Science provides us with the tools and methodlogies to solving interesting and complex problems.
- ## What are computers?
  - An electronic device that manipulates information (or data) using a combination of hardware and software.
  - Computers can be your phone, smart watch, a laptop, a tablet, drones, game console and more....
  - Binary data is used by computers to execute instructions that you command.
    - Binary data is made of a collection of 1's and 0's.   
    - Electrical singals to circuts are used to take your instructions(or commands, or actions) and translate them into binary data (signals) for the computer to execute.
  - Computers are made up of both hardware and software.
    - Hardware are actual physical compents that live inside and outside of a computer, this includes:
      - Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer. 
        - CPU process commands coming from different inputs.
        - CPU only executs commands, but does not store commands.
      - Commands are store in Memory which the CPU uses to retrieve commands to execute\calculate.
      - Inputs consist of keyboards, microphones, mouses, cameras.
      - Once the CPU completes executing a command, the information is sent to an output like monitors, cell phones, or watches, etc....
    - Software is all the computer programs, or code that runs inside of the hardware.
      - Software can be apps, games, a webpage, operating systems, etc...
      - Software tells the CPU what to do.
      - Software is not binary code, software is developed using programming languaes like Python.
      - Programming langugaes are built with tool to assist with converting your code into binary code for a computer to execute.
  - How do computers process comamnds?
    - We know that all computers do the same 4 things: input, store, process and output information.
      - Inputs: These are devices lthat takes your input and converts them into binary information.
      - Storing: This is handle by memory, which basically stores the information.
      - Processing: This is handle by the CPU, this is where all the calculations are done.
      - Output: These are devices that take the information and converts it into a physical output.

In the next section we will learn about the internet and then we will dive into programming.
