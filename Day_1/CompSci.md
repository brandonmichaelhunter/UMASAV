## Its about solving problems using COMPUTERS!!!

`"Computer science develops studentsâ€™ computational and critical thinking skills and shows them how to create, not simply use,new technologies. This fundamental knowledge is needed to prepare students for the 21st century, regardless of their ultimate field of study or occupation. `

`Computer science education encompasses 'the study of computers and algorithmic processes, including their principles, their hardware and software designs, their applications, and their impact on society.`

A few of the topics and activities that might be included in a computer science course include:
- Algorithmic problem-solving
- Computing and data analysis (managing, processing, visualizing and interpreting data)
- Human-computer interaction
- Modeling and simulating real-world problems
- Creating and manipulating graphics
- Programming (including game design)
- Security (including cryptography)
- Web design (illustrating principles of programming, human-computer interaction and abstraction)
- Robotics (designing and programming)
- Ethical and social issues in computing"

# Computers - What are computers and how do they work

## What is a computer?
- A programmable device for processing, storing, and displaying information or 
- An electronic device that manipulates information (or data) using a combination of hardware and software
## What are some examples are a computer?
- We know of desktop and laptop computers, but what about....
  - Cell Phones
  - Tablets 
  - Drones
  - Smart Devices (Washers, Dryers, Refrigerators, Watches, Theromstats, Cars)
  - Game Consoles (XBox, PlayStation)
## What can you do with computers? 
- Work with documents, presentations, spreadsheets and save them to a computer.
- Send emails
- Play computer games and more....
In this section we'll disucss what are computers, how do they work and what are the parts that make up a computer.

The first step before start learning how to program, is learning how computers work.

*"A computer is a machine or device that performs processes, calculations and operations based on instructions provided by a software or hardware program. It has the ability to accept data (input), process it, and then produce outputs.*

*Computers can also store data for later uses in appropriate storage devices, and retrieve whenever it is necessary.*

*Modern computers are electronic devices used for a variety of purposes ranging from browsing the web, writing documents, editing videos, creating applications, playing video games, etc.*

*They are designed to execute applications and provide a variety of solutions by combining integrated hardware and software components.*

*The earliest digital electronic device that could be defined as the first modern computer is the Colossus. Built in 1943-44, the Colossus was devised to crack the Lorenz SZ 40/42, a German encryption machine used to support military communications during World War II.*

*The device used 2,400 vacuum tubes to perform multiple boolean logical operations to decode encrypted data.*"
